# Gesture-Controlled Presentation Slides

This project utilizes the MediaPipe library to enable users to control presentation slides using hand gestures for a touchless and interactive experience. Key features include gesture recognition and customizable settings. Simply install MediaPipe, calibrate the system, and use gestures like swiping to navigate through slides, which are converted to images and fed to the program.
